# Quote-Machine

## Overview
A simple website that generates random quotes. The design is very simple. You can easily generate a quote from a simple click. There is no extra media to interfere.

## Usage
The quotes are generated by [forismatic](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) which is powered by [Alty](https://alty.co/). A live version is up and running [here](http://quote-machine.000webhostapp.com/). Also, it makes use of the [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

## Challenges
There was an issue with requesting json file from the api. It gave me a "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource" error. I fixed it by adding cors-anywhere proxy. More info [here](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere). I have included the file cors-anywhere.js for anyone who wants to use it here or anywhere else.

## Upcoming
Before adding additional content, I am looking to re-do the website in React.

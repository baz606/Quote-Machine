# Quote-Machine
A simple website that generates random quotes.

## Objective
The objective of this website is to keep everything very simple yet powerful. You can easily generate quotes from a simple click button. There is no extra media to interfere.

## Usage
The quotes are generated by [forismatic](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) which is powered by [Alty](https://alty.co/). A live version is up and running [here](http://quote-machine.000webhostapp.com/).

## Challenges
There was an issue with requesting json file from the api. It gave me a "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource" error. I fixed it by adding cors-anywhere proxy. More info [here](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere). So this issue was only with requesting a json file. When i changed it to an html file, the issue disappeared. Anyways, I have included the file cors-anywhere.js for anyone who wants to use it here or anywhere else.

## Upcoming
I will look to adding additional content to the website but keeping the "simple" as my primary objective.
